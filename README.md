# Sequencer: Visual AI Agent Workflow Orchestrator

Sequencer is a local-first workflow orchestrator for chaining prompts, agents, and OpenAI-compatible LLM calls into repeatable pipelines.

## 🚀 Core Concept: From Chatting to Sequencing

Most developers use AI agents (like Cline or Aider) in a linear chat. Sequencer moves you to an **assembly line** model:
1.  **Design**: Create a sequence of tasks (prompts).
2.  **Assign**: Choose the best agent for each specific task.
3.  **Start Sequence**: Execute the entire pipeline in one click, with real-time status tracking for every step.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Visual Pipeline Editor**: Drag-and-drop interface to reorder tasks and refine your workflow.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Assign different agents to different steps within a single project sequence.
- **Hybrid LLM Support**: Route requests through local servers (LM Studio) for privacy and cost, or connect to enterprise APIs for maximum intelligence.
- **Real-time Orchestration**: Monitor the state of your pipeline (`Pending`, `Running`, `Done/Failed`) as it executes.
- **Project-Based Management**: Organize different sequences into dedicated projects.
- **Transparent Logging**: Every exchange is captured in JSON format for audit and optimization.

## Why I Built This

I found myself manually coordinating workflows between LM Studio, coding agents, local models, and scripts. Repeating the same multi-step AI tasks became tedious.

Sequencer is my attempt to turn those workflows into autonomous pipelines that work across both local and cloud-based models.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **(Optional) Cline CLI** for Cline agent tasks
- **(Optional) Aider CLI** for Aider agent tasks

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mdoty4/sequencer.git
    cd sequencer
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```env
    PORT=4321
    LM_STUDIO_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
    ```

4.  **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:4321`.

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

Run Sequencer in a container with a single command:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:4321`.

### Docker Notes

- Logs are persisted in the `./logs` directory on the host
- The `.env` file is mounted read-only into the container
- A health check is configured at `/health`
- **Agent CLI tools** (cline, aider) must be available inside the container for agent tasks to execute. For UI-only usage the container works as-is.

### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start in background
docker compose up -d

# Stop
docker compose down

# Rebuild and start
docker compose up --build -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Remove container and volumes
docker compose down -v
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `4321` | Port the Sequencer server listens on |
| `LM_STUDIO_URL` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | Base URL for LM Studio API |

### Agent Configuration

Configure your agents through the web UI at **Settings**:

- **LLM Settings**: API base URL, API key, model selection
- **Telegram**: Bot token and chat ID for Telegram agent
- **Per-project overrides**: Each project can have its own LLM configuration

---

## 🎮 Using the Sequencer

### 1. Setting up your Agent (e.g., Cline)

To route an agent's requests through the Sequencer:
- Set the **API Provider** to `OpenAI Compatible`
- Set the **Base URL** to `http://localhost:4321/`

### 2. Building a Pipeline

- Navigate to the **Projects** tab and activate a project
- In the **Pipeline** editor, add prompt rows
- Assign an agent (Aider or Cline) to each row
- Toggle the "Orchestrate" switch for the tasks you want to include in the sequence

### 3. Executing the Sequence

Click **▶ Start Sequence**. Sequencer will execute the selected prompts in order, managing the hand-off between agents and tracking progress in real-time.

---

## 🤖 OpenClaw Integration

Sequencer includes a `skill.md` file that allows **OpenClaw** (and other AI agents) to discover and interact with Sequencer automatically. By providing the skill file, OpenClaw can:

- **Start, stop, and restart** the Sequencer server
- **Create and manage** projects and pipelines
- **Assign agents** and execute orchestration workflows
- **Troubleshoot** failed pipelines and review session logs

To use with OpenClaw, simply point it to the `skill.md` file in the project root. OpenClaw will use the defined workflows and API endpoints to control Sequencer programmatically.
